# Analysis of simulated electrons and muons through  a Water Cherenkov Detector (WCD) with ROOT-CERN
This repository contains a set of codes used in the final project of "Laboratorio avanzado" class, at Escuela de Ciencias Físicas y Matemáticas, Univesiad de San Carlos de Guatemala, around the mid of 2020. 

These codes are useful to calculate the histograms and profiles about:
1. The initial energy and cenital angle.
2. The initial energy and deposited energy.
3. The cenital angle and deposited energy.
4. The number of Cherenkov photons and deposited energy
5. The number of photons that make photoelectric effect and deposited energy.
6. The distance traveled and deposited energy.
7. The maximum pulse and deposited energy.
8. The pulse area and deposited energy.
9. The Rise time and pulse amplitude.

You need a .root file with the data to analyze. You can see the archive called Final-report.pdf (in Spanish) as an example.

Finally, you can use these codes to make another project.
